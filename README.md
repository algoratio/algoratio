- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fritz and I'm working
- on trading algorithms, option pricing
- and retrieval of market data. My
- academic background is in engineering
- and economics.
- As a true fossil, I started coding in
- basic, then 6502 assembler, on to
- Kernighan Ritchie C, and C++ from 1991.
- Little we knew what was to come, looking
- at C++ 20.
- Most of my numerical algorithms are in
- Python, I also touched Java and Scala.
